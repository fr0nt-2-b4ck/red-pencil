This is my first read me file.
I am tpying this out because I want to try to figure out how I can make sure that I understand how github works
What I have gathered so far is that this repository here is different from the instance of it that I cloned, because there is no direct link between
a remote repository and a local machine repository 
So you almost have to a manual syncing to make sure that you the changes are transferred between the two respositories

So, as of now, the changes on this document should not be available in the local machine

Adtiitonally 
my next step is to open visual code editor and from there fetch changes and then merge them? which at that point it might be better to execute the command pull
